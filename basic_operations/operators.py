# Arithmetic Operators
a = 61
b = 10
print a + b  # addition
print a - b  # subtraction
print a * b  # multiplication
print a ** b  # power
print a / b  # division, return's only the integer
print a % b  # modulo, return's only the remainder

# Logic Operators
a = 21
b = 3
print a < b  # less than
print a > b  # grater than
print a >= b  # grater or equal with
print a <= b  # less or equal with
print a == b  # equal with
print a != b  # not equal with

print a < b or a != b  # less than OR not equal with
print a < b and a != b  # less than AND not equal with
